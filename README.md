## Setup

Clone the `master` branch of this repo.
I would recommend setting up a Python virtual environment by doing the following
```
python -m venv .venv
```
and then activating it, [see here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) for more information.

Now install the dependencies by running
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
***
## Running veff

To run `veff` execute the following
```
python veff
```

To configure `veff` navigate to `veff/config.py` and change the configuration how you wish.
For more information on what effects are available, look in `veff/config_schema.py`.
